NOTES:

1. Unlike C++, Python will not automatically call base class initializer. It has to be called explicitly with super()

2. Method Resolution Order : is a way to determine the order in which the inheritance tree is searched when looking for an implementaion.

3. isinstance() can be used for type checking in Python.

4. issubclass() Determines if one class is a subclass of another
